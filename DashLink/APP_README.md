# Bookmarks Dashboard

A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to manage their bookmarks by adding, editing, and deleting bookmarks within categorized sections. The application stores bookmarks in a JSON file (`bookmarks.json`), making it lightweight and easy to run.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete bookmark categories
- Add, edit, and delete bookmarks within categories
- User-friendly web interface
- Lightweight JSON storage

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Bash (to run the setup script)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the app:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use the provided bash script (run_setup.sh) to install required dependencies and launch the app in detached mode. The script uses pip (not pip3), so ensure it's available in your environment.

```
bash run_setup.sh

```
This script will:

- Install the required libraries using `pip`
- Launch the app in detached mode (allowing you to continue using the terminal)
- Display the access address where the app can be reached

### Step 3: Access the Application

Once the script finishes running, you’ll see a message showing the URL where the app can be accessed. It should look something like this:

```
The app is running and can be accessed at: http://<your-local-ip>:5021

```

Open your browser and navigate to this URL.
